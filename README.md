# esp8266-weather-station
 esp8266 weather station using free Open-Meteo API (instead of discontinued OpenWeatherMapOneCall API 2.5)

 Can be programmed to ESP using Arduino IDE.
 
 Requires this library:
 https://github.com/ThingPulse/esp8266-weather-station
 Here you can also find detailed instructions on building your weather station.
 You have to install/copy this library in the Arduino IDE.
 
 Features you get with my code: 
 - uses Open-Meteo API
 - 4 icons per display page (instead of originally 3)
 - houry weather forecast for 8 hours
 - daily weather forecast for one week with min and max temperatures
 - BME280 sensor for indoor temperature, humidity, pressure
 
 Usable display: SSD1306 0.96 inch OLED or SH1106 1.3 inch OLED (set the one you have in the code).
 
 Parts: 
  - SSD1306 0.96 inch OLED or SH1106 1.3 inch OLED
  - esp8266 module
  - optional: BME280 sensor
 
 Enjoy!
